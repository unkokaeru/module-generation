### Question 1

#### Question

A random variable Z has a probability density function$$fZ(z)=\begin{cases}0.1e^{-0.1z}& z\geq 0,\\ 0& z< 0\end{cases}$$
- find the mean of Z
- find the median of Z
- find the interquartile distance of Z

### Question 2

#### Question

The mean and variance of a random variable T with probability density function$$fT(t)=\begin{cases}\frac{2}{15}-\frac{2t}{225}& 0\leq t\leq 15,\\ 0& otherwise\end{cases}$$are $E[T]= 5$ and $\sigma^2_T= 12.5$, respectively. Use the Chebyshev inequality$$P\left(|T- E[T]|\geq k\right)\leq\frac{\sigma^2_T}{k^2}$$to estimate the probability that $-2.5\leq T\leq 7.5$, $0\leq T\leq 10$.
Compare these estimates to the real probabilities.

### Question 3

#### Question

Buses arrive at a bus stop at 15-minute intervals starting at 7am(!). The buses are always perfectly on time, so arrive at 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45, ...
If a passenger arrives at the stop at a time that is uniformly distributed between 7 and 7:30,find the probability that she waits• less than 5 minutes for a bus;• at least 12 minutes for a bus.

### Question 4

#### Question

Suppose the joint pdf of $(X,Y)$ is given by$$f(x, y)=\begin{cases}\frac{6}{5}(x+ y^2)& 0\leq x\leq 1, 0\leq y\leq 1,\\ 0& otherwise\end{cases}$$
- Verify that this is a legitimate pdf.
- The probability $P(0\leq x\leq\frac{1}{4}, 0\leq y\leq\frac{1}{4})$.
