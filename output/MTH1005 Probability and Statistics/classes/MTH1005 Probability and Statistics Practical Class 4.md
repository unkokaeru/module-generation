### Question 1

#### Question

Let $Z$ be the 'number around the base when a 4 sided die is rolled'. 
• Write down a sample space for the experiment. 
• Define the values of $Z$ and the events they correspond to. 
• Write down the probability mass function of $Z$.

#### Solution

...

### Question 2

#### Question

Fully define random variables corresponding to the experiments. 
• 'number of heads shown when two coins are thrown'. 
• 'the number of successes out of 4 trials'. 
• An urn contains 3 white and 2 blue balls. Two balls are selected without replacement, and £1 is paid out for each blue ball in the selection.

### Question 3

#### Question

The cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the variables in questions 1 and 2 are given by the expression $F(a)= P(X\leq a)$. How do the plots of the CDFs look like?

### Question 4

#### Question

Let $X$ be the discrete random variable 'number of tails shown when two coins are thrown'. Define two more random variables: 
$X_1=$ the number of tails shown on the first coin, 
$X_2=$ the number of tails shown on the second coin. Show that $X$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ are random variables.

### Question 5

#### Question

In a game, 3 dice are rolled. The player bets £They get back £1 if they roll a single 5, £2 if 2 fives come up, and £3 if 3 fives come up (and their stake is returned). If no 5s come up, they lose their £1 stake. 
Calculate the value of the probability mass function. 
Calculate the probability mass function for a game with 4 dice.

### Question 6

#### Question

The probabilities that three men hit a target are respectively $\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{4}$, and $\frac{1}{3}$. Each man shoots once at the target. 
Find the probability $p$ that exactly one of them hits the target. 
If only one hits the target, what is the probability that it was the first man?
