Question 1
A variable Y has a probability density function
$$f_{Y}(y)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{4(2y+3)}& 0\leq y\leq 1,\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$
• compute the expectation value of Y and aY

### Question 2

#### Question

Question 2
A service station has both self-service and full-service islands. On each island, there is a single regular unleaded pump with two hoses. Let X denote the number of hoses being used on the self-service island at a particular time, and let Y denote the number of hoses on the full-service island in use at that time. The joint pmf of X and Y appears in the accompanying tabulation.

y  |  p(x, y)
0  |  0.10  0.04  0.02
1  |  0.08  0.20  0.06
2  |  0.06  0.14  0.30

a. What is P(X = 1 and Y = 1)?
b. Compute P(X \leq 1 and Y \leq 1).
c. Give a word description of the event {X != 0 and Y != 0}, and compute the probability of this event.
d. Compute the marginal pmf of X and of Y. Using $p_X(x)$, what is P(X \leq 1)?
e. Are X and Y independent random variables? Explain.

Question 3
Ada is a room usage surveyor. She took data on the number of people using classrooms in the MTH building.

small  medium  large
morning  17  7  3
afternoon  8  19  15

Let X be a random variable taking values 0, 1, 2 for small, medium and large room sizes. Also, let Y be a random variable taking values 0 and 1 for when the observation was in the morning or afternoon, respectively.
• Determine the joint probability mass function for X and Y, and the marginal probabilities of X and Y.
• Are X and Y independent? - (for independence $P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)$ for all x, y.
• Find the covariance and correlation of X and Y.

Question 4
Let X be the discrete random variable 'number of tails shown when two coins are thrown'.
Define two more random variables $X_{1}$ = the number of tails shown on the first coin and $X_{2}$ the number of tails shown on the second coin.
• Calculate the covariances and correlations of the random variables.

#### Question

Question 5
Suppose the joint pdf of (X, Y) is given by
$$f(x, y)=\begin{cases}\frac{3}{5}(x+ y^2)& 0\leq x\leq 1, 0\leq y\leq 1,\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$
• Verify that this is a legitimate pdf.
• The probability $P(0\leq x\leq\frac{1}{4}, 0\leq y\leq\frac{1}{4})$.
