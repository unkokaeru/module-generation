### Question 5

#### Question

In Glasgow, half of the days have some rain. The local weather forecaster is correct 2/3 of the time, i.e., the probability that she has predicted rain on a rainy day, and the probability that she predicts no rain on a dry day, are both equal to 2/3.
Draw a tree diagram - start labelling by whether it rains, then what the forecaster will predict and finally what the Glaswegian lady does.
Check you know what types of probability you are labelling on the diagram.
Calculate the probability that the lady has no umbrella, given that it rains.
Calculate the probability that she brings her umbrella, given that it doesn't rain.

### Question 6

#### Question

One bag contains two dice:
• a fair one that gives equiprobable outcomes of 1 to 6.
• a "rigged" one: throwing it always gets 6.
A player has rolled one of the dice and, without examining it, rolled it (once) to get a What is the probability that he used the loaded die?

### Question 7

#### Question

Microchips are made by three companies. 30% are supplied by firm I, 50% by II and 20% by III.
The probabilities of A = 'a defect in a chip' are P(A|I) = 0.03, P(A|II) = 0.04, P(A|III) = 0.01.
If an unlabeled box of chips turns up, what are the probabilities that the box came from I, II or III
(i) if a random test shows a defective chip?
(ii) if a random test shows a non-defective chip?
(iii) if the first chip was defective, and a second chip was then also tested and found defective?
