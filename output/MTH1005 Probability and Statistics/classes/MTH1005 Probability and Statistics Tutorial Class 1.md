### Question 1

#### Question

In Glasgow, half of the days have some rain. The local weather forecaster is correct $\frac{2}{3}$ of the time, i.e., the probability that she has predicted rain on a rainy day, and the probability that she predicts no rain on a dry day, is both equal to $\frac{2}{3}$. When rain is forecast, a Glaswegian lady takes her umbrella. When rain is not forecast, she takes it with probability $\frac{1}{3}$. 
$\bullet$ Draw a tree diagram - start labeling by whether it rains, then what the forecaster will predict, and finally what the Glaswegian lady does. 
$\bullet$ Check you know what types of probability you are labeling on the diagram. 
$\bullet$ Calculate the probability that the lady has no umbrella, given that it rains. 
$\bullet$ Calculate the probability that she brings her umbrella, given that it doesn’t rain.

### Question 2

#### Question

Microchips are made by three companies. 30% are supplied by the firm I, 50% by II and 20% by III. The probabilities of A = 'a defect in a chip' are P(A|I) = 0.03, P(A|II) = 0.04, P(A|III) = 0.If an unlabeled box of chips turns up, what are the probabilities that the box came from I, II, or III
(i) if a random test shows a defective chip?
(ii) if a random test shows a non-defective chip?
(iii) if the first chip was defective, and a second chip was then also tested and found defective?

### Question 3

#### Question

Find the cumulative distribution function of the following probability density function.
$$f_X(x)=
\begin{cases}
_{0},& x< 0
\\
\frac{1}{2},& 0\leq x\leq 2
\\
_{0},& x> 2
\end{cases}$$

### Question 4

#### Question

Confirm that the cdf you found, $F_X(x)$
$\bullet$ is monotonically increasing;
$\bullet$ tends to zero as x tends to $-∞$;
$\bullet$ tends to one as x →$∞$.
Check your solution by recovering the original $f_X(x)$ by differentiating the $F_X(x)$ you found.
