### Question

What is the exponential distribution and what are its key properties?

### Answer

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson point process. It is characterized by the probability density function $f(x;\lambda)=\begin{cases}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}&\text{for} x\geq 0,\\ 0&\text{for} x< 0,\end{cases}$ where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter. 

Key properties of the exponential distribution include:

### Question

In a queuing system, the time between two arrivals of customers follows an exponential distribution with a rate parameter of $\lambda= 0.1$ per minute. Calculate the probability that the next customer will arrive within 10 minutes.

### Answer

Using the cumulative distribution function $F(x;\lambda) = 1- e^{-\lambda x}$:
$$\begin{aligned}
P(X \leq 10) & = 1 - e^{-0.1 \times 10} \\
& = 1 - e^{-1} \\
& \approx 0.6321.

Explain the difference between point estimation and interval estimation, providing an example for each.

### Answer

**Point Estimation:**  
Point estimation involves using a single value (point estimate) to estimate an unknown population parameter. For instance, if we want to estimate the average height of students in a university and we calculate the sample mean height of 170 cm from a sample of 50 students, 170 cm serves as the point estimate for the population mean height.

**Interval Estimation:**  
Interval estimation provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. This is achieved through calculating a confidence interval that considers both the sample statistic and the margin of error. For example, if a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height based on student data is (165 cm, 175 cm), we can be 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this interval.

---

### Question

Suppose you are given a single sample of test scores from a class of students. How would you use hypothesis testing to determine if the average score is significantly different from a specified value?

### Answer

To determine if the average score from the sample is significantly different from a specified value using hypothesis testing:

1. Formulate the null hypothesis ($H_0$) stating no difference between the average score and the specified value.
2. Set up the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) specifying the direction of the difference (e.g., greater, less than, not equal to).
3. Choose an appropriate significance level (commonly 5%) to assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.
4. Perform the necessary statistical tests (e.g., t-test) using the sample data to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

---

### Question

Discuss the importance of confidence intervals in single sample procedures, using a real-life scenario to illustrate their significance.

### Answer

**Importance of Confidence Intervals:**  
Confidence intervals provide a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter. They offer a measure of uncertainty and precision in estimation, aiding researchers in making reliable inferences about the population based on sample data.

**Illustration with Real-life Scenario:**  
In medical research, when testing the effectiveness of a new drug based on a sample of patients, constructing confidence intervals for treatment effects is crucial. These intervals help researchers understand the plausible range of effects the drug may have in the broader population, providing insights into the drug's efficacy and potential impact.
