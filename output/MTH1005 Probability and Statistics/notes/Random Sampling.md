# Random Sampling

In statistics, **random sampling** is a technique used to select a subset of individuals (or observations) from a larger population. The key characteristic of random sampling is that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected into the sample. This helps to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, allowing us to make accurate inferences about the population based on the characteristics of the sample.

## Methods of Random Sampling

There are several methods of random sampling, including:

1. **Simple Random Sampling:** In simple random sampling, each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected for the sample. This can be done with or without replacement. With replacement means that once an individual is selected, they are put back into the population before the next selection.

2. **Stratified Sampling:** In stratified sampling, the population is divided into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics. Then, random samples are taken from each stratum. This method ensures that each subgroup is adequately represented in the sample.

3. **Cluster Sampling:** In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters or groups, and then a random sample of clusters is selected. All individuals within the selected clusters are included in the sample.

## Importance of Random Sampling

Random sampling is crucial in statistics because it helps to reduce bias and ensure the validity of statistical conclusions. Without random sampling, there is a risk of selection bias, where certain individuals are more likely to be included in the sample than others. This can lead to inaccurate or misleading results.

## Historical Context

The concept of random sampling has a long history, dating back to the work of statistician Ronald A. Fisher in the early 20th century. Fisher was a pioneer in the field of experimental design and is credited with developing many of the foundational principles of modern statistics, including the importance of randomization in sampling.

## Real-Life Example

Suppose you are conducting a survey to estimate the average income of households in a city. To obtain a random sample, you could assign a unique number to each household in the city and then use a random number generator to select a subset of numbers. You would then survey the households corresponding to those numbers to gather the data needed for your analysis.

## Exam Questions

1. Explain the difference between simple random sampling and stratified sampling. Provide an example of when each method would be appropriate.
2. Why is random sampling important in statistical analysis? What are the potential consequences of not using random sampling?
3. Discuss the historical significance of random sampling and the contributions of Ronald A. Fisher to the development of this concept in statistics.
