# Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

In probability theory, random variables are used to represent possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. Random variables can be classified into two main types: **discrete random variables** and **continuous random variables**.

## Discrete Random Variables

A discrete random variable is one that can take on a countable number of distinct values. This means that the possible values of a discrete random variable can be listed out individually. 

### Properties of Discrete Random Variables:

- The probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value.
  - The PMF must satisfy two conditions:
    1. The probability of each value is between 0 and 1.
    2. The sum of the probabilities of all possible values is equal to 1.

- The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a discrete random variable gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a specific value.
  
### Example:
Suppose we have a discrete random variable X representing the number of heads when flipping a fair coin twice. The possible values of X are 0, 1, and 2, with corresponding probabilities of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4, respectively.

## Continuous Random Variables

A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value within a specified range or interval. This means that the possible values of a continuous random variable form a continuous set, such as all real numbers in a given range.

### Properties of Continuous Random Variables:

- The probability density function (PDF) gives the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a specific value.
  - The PDF must satisfy two conditions:
    1. The PDF is non-negative for all values.
    2. The total area under the PDF over its range is equal to 1.
    
- The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a continuous random variable gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a specific value.

### Example:
Consider a continuous random variable Y representing the height of students in a college. The range of Y is from 150 cm to 200 cm, and the PDF could be modeled by a normal distribution with a mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm.

## Historical Context:

The distinction between discrete and continuous random variables has its roots in the work of early mathematicians like Jacob Bernoulli, Abraham de Moivre, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. These pioneers made significant contributions to the development of probability theory and laid the foundations for the study of random variables.

## Real-life Example:

Suppose we want to model the time taken for a customer to complete a transaction at a bank. This time duration would be a continuous random variable, as it can take on any non-negative real value within a certain range.
