# Single Sample Procedures

In statistics, single sample procedures are statistical methods used to analyze data from a single sample, as opposed to comparing two or more samples. These procedures are used to draw inferences about population parameters based on the information obtained from a single sample.

## Point Estimation
**Point estimation** is a procedure where a single value (a point estimate) is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. The most common point estimate for the population mean is the sample mean, denoted by $\bar{x}$.

**Example:** Let's say we want to estimate the average height of students in a university. We measure the heights of 50 students and calculate the sample mean height to be 170 cm. In this case, 170 cm is our point estimate for the population mean height.

## Interval Estimation
**Interval estimation** is a procedure that provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. This is done by calculating a confidence interval, which takes into consideration both the sample statistic and the margin of error.

**Example:** Continuing with the example above, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height based on the sample data. If the interval is (165 cm, 175 cm), we are 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this range.

## Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis testing** is a method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves setting up a hypothesis (null and alternative) and using statistical techniques to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

**Example:** Suppose we want to test if the average waiting time at a bus stop is less than 10 minutes. We collect data on waiting times and set up the null hypothesis $H_0:\mu= 10$ and the alternative hypothesis $H_1:\mu< 10$. By conducting hypothesis testing, we can determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

### Real-life Example
In medical research, single sample procedures can be used to estimate the effectiveness of a new drug based on a single sample of patients. Researchers can calculate point estimates for treatment effects and construct confidence intervals to determine the range of effects the drug may have in the population.

### Historical Context
Single sample procedures have been developed and refined over centuries as statisticians and mathematicians sought ways to make accurate inferences about populations based on limited sample data. The works of pioneers in statistics like Ronald Fisher and Jerzy Neyman laid the foundation for these procedures.

## Exam Questions
1. Explain the difference between point estimation and interval estimation, providing an example for each.
2. Suppose you are given a single sample of test scores from a class of students. How would you use hypothesis testing to determine if the average score is significantly different from a specified value?
3. Discuss the importance of confidence intervals in single sample procedures, using a real-life scenario to illustrate their significance.
