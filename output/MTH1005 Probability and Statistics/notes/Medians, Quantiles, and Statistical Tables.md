# Medians, Quantiles, and Statistical Tables

In statistics, medians and quantiles are key measures that help us understand the distribution of a dataset. These measures are important in summarizing data and making inferences about the population from which the data is drawn.

## Medians

The **median** of a dataset is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is simply the middle value. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to extreme values (outliers) compared to the mean and provides a robust measure of central tendency.

For example, consider the dataset {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}. The median is 5, as it is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order.

## Quantiles

**Quantiles** divide a dataset into equal parts. The most common quantile is the median, which divides the data into two equal halves. Other quantiles include quartiles (which divide the data into four parts), quintiles (which divide the data into five parts), and percentiles (which divide the data into 100 parts).

For instance, the first quartile $Q_{1}$ is the value below which 25% of the data fall, the second quartile $Q_{2}$ is the median, and the third quartile $Q_{3}$ is the value below which 75% of the data fall.

## Statistical Tables

Statistical tables are precalculated tables used in statistics to determine critical values of various statistical distributions, such as the standard normal distribution, t-distribution, F-distribution, and Chi-square distribution. These tables are often used in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and other statistical analyses.

For example, a standard normal distribution table provides the probabilities associated with different z-scores, allowing us to find the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a given value.

## Historical Context

The concept of medians and quantiles dates back to ancient times. The idea of the median can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used it in various contexts, including in geometry. Quantiles have been used in statistics since the early 18th century, with early work by John Arbuthnot and Carl Friedrich Gauss contributing to the development of these concepts.

## Real-life Example

Imagine you are analyzing the salaries of employees in a company. By calculating the median salary, you can determine the middle value that divides the salaries into two equal halves. This can be particularly useful when there are outliers in the dataset, as the median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean.

## Exam Questions
1. Calculate the median of the following dataset: {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}.
2. What is the third quartile $Q_{3}$ of the dataset {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}?
3. Explain the difference between a quartile and a percentile, providing an example to illustrate each.
