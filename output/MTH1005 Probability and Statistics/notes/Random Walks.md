# Random Walks

Random walks are a fundamental concept in mathematics, probability theory, and physics. They can be thought of as a mathematical model of a path that consists of a succession of random steps. Random walks have applications in various fields, such as finance, biology, computer science, and physics.

## Definition

A **random walk** can be defined as a mathematical object that describes a path consisting of a sequence of random steps on a mathematical space. The most common form of random walk is a one-dimensional random walk on the integers, where at each step, a particle moves either to the right or left with equal probability.

In discrete time, a one-dimensional random walk can be defined as follows: Let $X_1, X_2, X_3,\ldots$ be independent and identically distributed random variables representing the steps taken at each time step. The position of the walker at time $ n$ is given by 

$$ S_n= X_1+ X_2+\cdots+ X_n.$$

## Properties

1. **Symmetry**: In a simple random walk, the steps taken are usually symmetrical, meaning that the probability of moving to the right or left is the same.
  
2. **Gambler's Ruin**: Random walks are used to model situations like the Gambler's Ruin problem, where a gambler starts with an initial stake and can either win or lose money with each bet.

3. **Recurrence and Transience**: A simple random walk on the integers is recurrent, meaning that it will return to its starting point with probability 1. However, in higher dimensions, random walks can be transient.

## Examples

1. **One-Dimensional Random Walk**: Consider a one-dimensional random walk where a particle moves left or right with equal probability at each step. This simple model can be used to study various phenomena, such as stock prices or molecular motion.

2. **Symmetric Random Walk**: In a symmetric random walk, the steps taken are symmetric around zero. This type of random walk is commonly used in probability theory and statistical mechanics.

3. **Brownian Motion**: Brownian motion is a continuous random walk where the particle moves continuously in space and time, undergoing random displacement due to collisions with other particles.

## Historical Context

Random walks were first introduced by Karl Pearson in 1905 to study the phenomenon of genetic drift. The concept was further developed by Albert Einstein in 1905 to describe Brownian motion. Since then, random walks have become a central topic in probability theory and have found applications in various scientific disciplines.

## Real-Life Applications

1. **Finance**: Random walks are commonly used to model stock prices and financial markets, where the price of a stock at a future time is considered to be a random variable.

2. **Biology**: Random walks are used to model the movement of molecules in a liquid, the foraging behavior of animals, and the spread of diseases in a population.

3. **Computer Science**: Random walks are used in algorithms for generating random numbers, simulating physical systems, and optimizing search algorithms.

## Exam Questions

1. Discuss the properties of a simple one-dimensional random walk.
  
2. How is a symmetric random walk different from a one-dimensional random walk?
  
3. Explain the significance of random walks in modelling real-life phenomena such as stock prices and molecular motion.
