# Normal Mean and Variance, Population Proportion

In statistics, the normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about its mean, with its shape determined by its mean and variance. When we talk about normal mean and variance, we are referring to the mean and variance of a normal distribution.

## Normal Mean and Variance:

Let's consider a random variable $X$ that follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The mean $\mu$ represents the center of the distribution, while the variance $\sigma^2$ measures the spread of the distribution. 

The probability density function (pdf) of a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ is given by:

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

The mean of the normal distribution is $\mu$, and the variance is $\sigma^2$. It is important to note that the standard deviation of the distribution is the square root of the variance, denoted by $\sigma$.

Historically, the normal distribution has been widely used in various fields such as physics, social sciences, finance, and engineering due to its mathematical properties and applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Example:
Suppose the heights of students in a certain class follow a normal distribution with a mean of 160 cm and a variance of 25 cm$^2$. Find the probability that a randomly selected student is shorter than 170 cm.

In this example, $X\sim N(160, 25)$, and we are interested in finding $P(X< 170)$. By standardizing and using the properties of the normal distribution, we can calculate this probability.

## Population Proportion:

In statistics, a population proportion refers to the proportion of individuals in a population that possess a certain characteristic of interest. It is often denoted by the symbol $p$. The population proportion is a parameter that describes the entire population, and it is a key quantity in inferential statistics.

When dealing with population proportions, we are often interested in estimating the population proportion from a sample proportion. This estimation involves calculating a confidence interval for the population proportion based on the sample data.

### Example:
Consider a population of voters in a city where 60% support a particular candidate. If a random sample of 500 voters is taken, what is the probability that the sample proportion supporting the candidate is within 3% of the population proportion?

In this scenario, we are interested in calculating the probability that the sample proportion is within the interval $(0.57, 0.63)$. By using the properties of sampling distributions and the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, we can make this calculation.

## Exam Questions:
1. A random variable $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean 50 and variance 16. Calculate the standard deviation of $X$.
2. A survey indicates that 70% of households in a city have pets. If a random sample of 200 households is selected, what is the probability that the sample proportion of households with pets is greater than 0.75?
3. In a manufacturing process, the lengths of a certain component follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm. What is the probability that a randomly selected component has a length between 95 cm and 105 cm?
