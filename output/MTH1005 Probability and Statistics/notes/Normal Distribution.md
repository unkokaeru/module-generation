# Normal Distribution

## Overview:
The **normal distribution**, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric around its mean, denoted by the parameters $\mu$ (mean) and $\sigma^2$ (variance). The bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution is characterized by the famous bell curve, with 68% of the data falling within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. 

## Probability Density Function (PDF):
The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by:

$$f(x|\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where $x$ is the random variable and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the parameters.

## Properties:
1. Symmetry: The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean.
2. Universality: The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.

## Real-life Examples:
1. **Height**: Human height often follows a normal distribution. The average height and standard deviation may vary between populations, but the distribution tends to be bell-shaped.
2. **IQ Scores**: IQ scores are often assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
3. **Measurement Errors**: Errors in measurements due to various factors often follow a normal distribution.

## Historical Context:
The normal distribution was first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the early 19th century, hence its alternative name, the Gaussian distribution. Gauss introduced the normal distribution as a method to model errors in astronomical observations. The normal distribution gained widespread recognition due to its simplicity and numerous applications in various fields of study.

## Exam Questions:
1. Explain the concept of the normal distribution and its key properties.
2. Describe an example from real life where the normal distribution is applicable and explain why it fits the situation.
3. What was the historical background behind the development of the normal distribution and who played a key role in its establishment?
