# Independent Events

In probability theory, two events are considered independent if the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence or non-occurrence of the other. More formally, two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:

$$P(A\cap B)= P(A)\cdot P(B)$$

where $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of events $A$ and $B$ occurring, respectively, and $P(A\cap B)$ is the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring simultaneously.

## Understanding Independent Events

To understand the concept of independent events, consider a fair six-sided die. If we define event $A$ as rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6) and event $B$ as rolling a number less than 5 (1, 2, 3, or 4), then the occurrence of event $A$ (rolling an even number) does not affect the occurrence of event $B$ (rolling a number less than 5). Thus, events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

On the other hand, if we define event $A$ as drawing a red card from a deck of cards, and event $B$ as drawing a queen from the same deck, these events are not independent because the probability of drawing a queen depends on whether a red card was drawn first.

## Calculation of Independent Events

When two events $A$ and $B$ are independent, the probability of both events occurring can be calculated using the formula:

$$P(A\cap B)= P(A)\cdot P(B)$$

For example, if the probability of event $A$ is $0.4$ and the probability of event $B$ is $0.6$, and the events are independent, the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring is:

$$P(A\cap B)= 0.4\cdot 0.6= 0.24$$

## Real-Life Example

Consider the scenario of flipping a fair coin and rolling a fair six-sided die. The event of getting heads on the coin flip and rolling a 3 on the die are independent events because the outcome of the coin flip does not affect the outcome of the die roll.

## Historical Context

The concept of independent events has its roots in the early development of probability theory. Mathematicians like Pierre-Simon Laplace and Jacob Bernoulli made significant contributions to the understanding of independent events in the context of probability.

## Exam Questions

1. Consider two events $A$ and $B$ with probabilities $P(A)= 0.3$ and $P(B)= 0.5$. If $A$ and $B$ are independent, calculate the probability of both events occurring, $P(A\cap B)$.
   
2. Explain with an example why the events "drawing a heart from a deck of cards" and "drawing a face card from the same deck" are not independent.
   
3. A bag contains 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. If two marbles are drawn without replacement, are the events of drawing a red marble on the first draw and drawing a blue marble on the second draw independent? Justify your answer.
