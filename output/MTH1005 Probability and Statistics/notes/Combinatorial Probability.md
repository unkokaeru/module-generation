# Combinatorial Probability

Combinatorial probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of an event happening based on combinatorial methods. It is a fundamental topic in probability theory and has applications in various fields such as statistics, computer science, and engineering.

## Basic Concepts

### Sample Space

The sample space, denoted by $S$, is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, when tossing a fair six-sided die, the sample space is $S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

### Events

An event is a subset of the sample space, representing a collection of possible outcomes. The probability of an event $E$, denoted by $P(E)$, is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of $E$ occurring.

### Counting Methods

#### Permutations

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, denoted by $P(n, r)$, is given by:

$$P(n, r)=\frac{n!}{(n- r)!}$$

where $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$ ($n!= n\times(n-1)\times...\times 2\times 1$).

#### Combinations

A combination is a selection of objects without considering the order. The number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, denoted by $\binom{n}{r}$ or $C(n, r)$, is given by:

$$C(n, r)=\frac{n!}{r!\times(n- r)!}$$

### Probability of an Event

The probability of an event $E$ occurring is given by:

$$P(E)=\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$

## Real-Life Example

Imagine you have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. What is the probability of drawing a heart from the deck? 

The sample space consists of 52 cards, and there are 13 hearts in the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing a heart is:

$$P(\text{Heart})=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}$$

This demonstrates the application of combinatorial probability in a real-life scenario.

## Historical Context

Combinatorial probability has roots in various historical developments. The concept of permutations and combinations dates back to ancient civilizations like ancient Greece and India. The study of probability itself has evolved over centuries, with contributions from mathematicians such as Blaise Pascal and Pierre-Simon Laplace.

## Exam Questions

1. A standard deck of 52 cards contains 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. What is the probability of drawing a diamond from the deck?
2. In how many ways can a committee of 3 students be selected from a group of 8 students?
3. An experiment involves rolling two fair six-sided dice. What is the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 on the dice?

These questions test your understanding of basic concepts in combinatorial probability and demonstrate the practical applications of the topic. Happy exploring!
