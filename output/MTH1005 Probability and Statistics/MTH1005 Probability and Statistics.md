## Notes

### 1. Probability Theory

#### 1.1 Basic Concepts

- **[[Probability Spaces]]**: Understanding the framework for modeling random experiments.
- **[[Combinatorial Probability]]**: Utilizing counting techniques to calculate probabilities.

#### 1.2 Conditional Probability and Independence

- **[[Conditional Probability]]**: Assessing the likelihood of an event given another event has occurred.
- **[[Bayes' Theorem]]**: A formula to update probabilities based on new information.
- **[[Independent Events]]**: Events that do not influence each other's probabilities.

### 2. Random Variables and Distributions

#### 2.1 Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

- **[[Discrete Random Variables]]**: Variables that take on a countable number of distinct values.
- **[[Continuous Random Variables]]**: Variables that can take on any value within a range.

#### 2.2 Distribution Functions

- **[[Distribution Function]]**: Describing the probabilities of a random variable taking on specific values.
- **[[Density Function]]**: Describing the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range.

### 3. Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

#### 3.1 Expectation and Variance

- **[[Expectation]]**: The average value a random variable is expected to take.
- **[[Variance]]**: A measure of the spread of values around the mean.

#### 3.2 Covariance and Correlation

- **[[Covariance]]**: Assessing how two random variables change together.
- **[[Correlation]]**: Measuring the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

#### 3.3 Other Statistical Measures

- **[[Medians and Quantiles]]**: Descriptive statistics for central tendency and distribution.
- **[[Statistical Tables]]**: References for critical values and distributions in statistical analysis.

### 4. Common Probability Distributions

- **[[Binomial Distribution]]**: Modeling the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
- **[[Geometric Distribution]]**: Describing the number of trials until the first success.
- **[[Poisson Distribution]]**: Modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **[[Normal Distribution]]**: Symmetric distribution often used in statistical inference.
- **[[Exponential Distribution]]**: Modeling the time between events in a Poisson process.

### 5. Sampling and Inference

#### 5.1 Populations and Samples

- **[[Random Sampling]]**: Techniques for selecting a representative subset of a population.
- **[[Probability Models for Data]]**: Mathematical models to describe and analyze data.

#### 5.2 Statistical Inference

- **[[Confidence Intervals]]**: Estimating population parameters with a range of values.
- **[[Single Sample Procedures]]**: Statistical methods for analyzing a single sample.
- **[[Hypothesis Testing]]**: Making inferences about population parameters based on sample data.

### 6. Markov Chains and Random Walks

- **[[Markov Chains]]**: Stochastic processes where the future state depends only on the present state.
- **[[Random Walks]]**: Modeling the path of a process where each step is random.
