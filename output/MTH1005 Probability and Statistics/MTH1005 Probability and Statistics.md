#### 1.1 Basic Concepts

- **[[Probability Spaces]]**: Framework for modeling random experiments and events.
- **[[Combinatorial Probability]]**: Calculating probabilities through counting techniques.

#### 1.2 Conditional Probability and Independence

- **[[Conditional Probability]]**: Probability of an event given another event has occurred.
- **[[Bayes’ Theorem]]**: Formula to update probabilities based on new information.
- **[[Independent Events]]**: Events that do not influence each other's probabilities.

### 2. Random Variables and Distributions

#### 2.1 Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

- **[[Discrete Random Variables]]**: Variables with countable outcomes.
- **[[Continuous Random Variables]]**: Variables with outcomes in a continuous range.
  
#### 2.2 Distribution Functions and Density Functions

- **[[Distribution Function]]**: Function describing probabilities of a random variable.
- **[[Density Function]]**: Function representing probability density for continuous variables.

#### 2.3 Expectation and Variance

- **[[Expectation]]**: Average value of a random variable.

### 3. Probability Distributions

#### 3.1 Common Distributions

- **[[Binomial Distribution]]**: Distribution of the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
- **[[Geometric Distribution]]**: Distribution of the number of trials until the first success.
- **[[Poisson Distribution]]**: Distribution for the number of events occurring in a fixed interval.
- **[[Normal Distribution]]**: Bell-shaped distribution with a defined mean and variance.
- **[[Exponential Distribution]]**: Distribution modeling time between events in a Poisson process.
