## Notes

### 1. Probability Theory

#### 1.1 Basic Concepts

- **Probability Spaces**: Understanding the framework for defining probabilities.
- **Combinatorial Probability**: Techniques for counting outcomes in probability problems.

#### 1.2 Conditional Probability and Independence

- **Conditional Probability**: Probability of an event given another event has occurred.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Formula for updating probabilities based on new information.
- **Independent Events**: Events that do not influence each other's probabilities.

#### 1.3 Random Variables

- **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**: Different types of variables in probability theory.
- **Distribution Function**: Function describing the probabilities of a random variable.
- **Density Function**: Function describing the probability density of a continuous random variable.

#### 1.4 Expectation and Variance

- **Expectation**: Average value of a random variable.
- **Variance**: Measure of the spread of a random variable's distribution.

#### 1.5 Covariance and Correlation

- **Covariance**: Measure of how two random variables change together.
- **Correlation**: Measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
- **Conditional Distributions and Conditional Expectation**: Understanding distributions and expectations given certain conditions.

#### 1.6 Special Probability Distributions

- **Binomial Distribution**: Probability distribution of the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Geometric Distribution**: Probability distribution of the number of trials needed to get the first success.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped distribution defined by its mean and standard deviation.
- **Exponential Distribution**: Probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson process.

### 2. Statistical Inference

#### 2.1 Populations and Samples

- **Populations and Samples**: Understanding the difference and relationship between the whole group and a subset.
- **Random Sampling**: Method of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population.
- **Probability Models for Data**: Models used to describe and analyze data.

#### 2.2 Estimation

- **Confidence Intervals**: Range of values within which a population parameter is estimated to lie.
- **Single Sample Procedures**: Techniques for estimating population parameters with one sample.

#### 2.3 Hypothesis Testing

- **Introductory Ideas and Concepts**: Basic principles of hypothesis testing.

### 3. Stochastic Processes

#### 3.1 Markov Chains and Random Walks

- **Markov Chains**: Stochastic process where the future state depends only on the current state.
- **Random Walks**: Mathematical model of a path that consists of a succession of random steps.
