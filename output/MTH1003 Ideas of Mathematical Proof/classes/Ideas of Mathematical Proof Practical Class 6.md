### Question 7

#### Question

Use the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr√∂der theorem to show that $|A|=|B|$ by producing injective mappings A $\to$ B and B $\to$ A, where A is the square $A=[0, 1]\times[0, 1]$ and B is the disc $B=\{(x, y)| x^2+ y^2\leq 1\}$. *Hint: use a geometric construction by uniformly 'shrinking' one object and then placing within the other.*
