### Question 1

#### Question

Give an example of finite sets $A, B, X, Y$ such that $(A\times X)\cup(B\times Y)\neq(A\cup B)\times(X\cup Y)$. (Hint: try small sets, say, subsets of $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$).

### Question 2

#### Question

For a fixed set $S$, consider $P(S)$ (set of all subsets of $S$) ordered by inclusion. For $A, B\subseteq S$, what is $\text{sup}\{A, B\}$ with respect to this order? What is $\text{inf}\{A, B\}$?

### Question 3

#### Question

How to tie a goat so it can eat grass exactly within a square? It is allowed to use several leashes, with several pegs. For example, one peg and leash mean that the goat eats within a circle. It is also allowed to string one rope tightly between two pegs, and to tie the goat with leash to a small ring sliding on the first rope. (Hint: use intersections of sets).
