### Question 2

#### Question

Let $A=\{1, 2,\ldots, 100\}$ be the set of all integers from 1 to Let $R$ be a relation on $P(A)$ (the set of all subsets of $A$) defined as $B R C$ if $|B|\leq|C|$. Determine if $R$ is (1) transitive, (2) reflexive, (3) symmetric, (4) antisymmetric, in each case giving a proof if yes, or a counterexample if not. Hence state whether $R$ is an order, or an equivalence, or neither.

### Question 3

#### Question

On the set $S=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$, consider the relation $R$ defined as $a R b$ if $a| b$ (that is, $a$ divides $b$). Draw the diagram of $R$ as a subset of $S\times S$.

### Question 4

#### Question

Let $\sim$ be a relation on the set $R\times R$ defined by $(x, y)\sim(a, b)$ if $y-|x|= b-|a|$. (1) Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence. (2) What is the equivalence class of $(2,-3)$ with respect to this equivalence $\sim$?

### Question 5

#### Question

Consider the order relation on $\mathbb{N}$ defined by divisibility: $a| b$ (when $b= ak$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$). What are the infimum and supremum of the set $S=\{8, 12, 36\}$? Does this set have the greatest element? the smallest element?

### Question 6

#### Question

Consider the lexicographical order $\leq_L$ on $R\times R$, which means that by definition $(a, b)\leq_L(c, d)$ if either $a< c$ (while $b$ and $d$ can be any), or $a= c$ and $b\leq d$. (a) Find the supremum (least upper bound), if it exists, with respect to $\leq_L$ of the set $D=\{(x, y)| x^2+ y^2\leq 1\}$ (the disc of radius 1 with center at the origin, including the unit circle). (b) Find the supremum (least upper bound), if it exists, with respect to $\leq_L$ of the set $D_0=\{(x, y)| x^2+ y^2< 1\}$ (the disc of radius 1 with center at the origin, without the boundary unit circle).

### Question 7

#### Question

On the set $S=\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, consider the relation $\sim$ defined as $(m_1, n_1)\sim(m_2, n_2)$ if $m_1\cdot n_2= m_2\cdot n_1$. Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence. Describe the equivalence class of $(1, 2)$ with respect to this equivalence $\sim$.
