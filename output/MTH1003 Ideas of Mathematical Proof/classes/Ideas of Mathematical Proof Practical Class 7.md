### Question 2

#### Question

Let $P(x, y)$ be the predicate $x> y$, and $Q(x, y)$ the predicate $x^2< y^2$, with universe of discourse $U=\mathbb{R}$. (a) What is the truth value of $P(x, y)\Rightarrow Q(x, y)$ (1) for $x=-3$, $y= 2$? (2) for $x= 2$, $y=-1$? (b) What is the truth value (1) of $\forall x\forall y(P(x, y)\Rightarrow Q(x, y))$? (2) of $\forall y\exists x(P(x, y)\Rightarrow Q(x, y))$?

### Question 3

#### Question

Let $x$ denote a student in UoL, and $y$ a song of Beatles. Let $P(x, y)$ denote the predicate “$x$ likes $y$”. (a) Express in symbolic form using quantifiers the statement “Some students in UoL do not like any of Beatles’ songs”. (b) Apply the rules for negations of quantified statements to express the negation of the expression obtained in part (a) so that negation sign is not before quantifiers. (c) Translate into natural language the formula obtained in part (b).

### Question 4

#### Question

Let $U=\mathbb{R}$. Determine which of these statements are true: (a) $\forall x\forall y(x^2< 2xy)$; (b) $\exists x\forall y(x^2< 2xy)$; (c) $\forall x\exists y(x^2\leq 2xy)$; (d) $\forall y\exists x(x^2< 2xy)$.

### Question 5

#### Question

Recall the theorem that $\aleph_0$ is the smallest infinite cardinal; in other words: if there is an injective mapping $B\rightarrow A$ and $|A|=\aleph_0$, then $B$ is countable. Use this theorem to show that any set consisting of pairwise disjoint discs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (each of radius $> 0$) is countable. *Hint: see the solution of question 5.5 in Practical W_{2}2 and use the fact that $|\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}|=\aleph_0$.*
