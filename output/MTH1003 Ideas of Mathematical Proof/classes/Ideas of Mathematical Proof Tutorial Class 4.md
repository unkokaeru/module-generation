### Question 1

#### Question

How does the graph of a function $f(x)$ change under the following transformations $where$a$ is a constant$? That is, how to obtain the graph of $F(x)$ from the graph of $f(x)$, where (1) $F(x)= f(x)+ a$; (2) $F(x)= f(x+ a)$; (3) $F(x)= f(ax)$.

#### Solution

...

### Question 2

#### Question

Assume that the mapping $f:[0, 1)\rightarrow[1,\infty)$, $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, is a bijection. Apply transformations in Question 1 to the mapping $f$ to produce a bijection $F:[2, 4)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$.

#### Solution

### Question 3

#### Question

Prove that the set $W$ of all finite sequences ('words') composed of two letters $A, B$ is countable. *Hints: One method is to use a theorem in the lectures by which it is sufficient to produce an injective mapping to $\mathbb{N}$. Another method is to describe a systematic enumeration of all such words, that is, to show that the set $W$ can be represented as a sequence.*
