### Question 1

#### Question

Prove that the following sets have the same cardinality by producing explicitly a bijection between the sets and describing this bijection
(1) by a formula for $|(-∞, 0]|=|[3,+∞)|$;
(2) by representing the set on the right as a sequence: $|ℕ|=|{a, b, c}∪ ℕ|$;
(3) by any method: $|{a, b}× ℤ|=|ℕ|$;
(4) by using a sequence of points: $[0, 1]=|(0, 1)|$;
(5) geometrically: $(0, 1)=|(0,∞)|$ *Hint: for example, first construct a bijection of (0, 1) onto a quarter of a circle (without endpoints), and then a bijection of this quarter of a circle onto (0, ∞) similarly to the stereographic projection in the lectures.*

### Question 2

#### Question

A theorem in the lectures says that if $f: B→ A$ is an injective mapping and $A$ is countable, then $B$ is also countable. Use this theorem to prove that $|ℕ× ℕ× ℕ|= ℵ₀$. *Hint: one method is to use products of powers of three fixed primes as images of triples of positive integers.*

### Question 3

#### Question

Let $S$ be the set of all sequences of the form $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3},...)$, where every $a_{i}$ is either $A$ or $B$. Use Cantor's “diagonal method” to prove that the set $S$ is not countable.

### Question 4

#### Question

Recall that $\{0, 1\}×\{0, 1\}×\{0, 1\}$ consists of triples of 1s and 0s, and $℘(\{a, b, c\})$ is the set of all subsets of $\{a, b, c\}$. Consider the mapping $f:℘(\{a, b, c\})→\{0, 1\}×\{0, 1\}×\{0, 1\}$ in which a subset $X⊆\{a, b, c\}$ is mapped to a string of length 3 consisting of 0s and 1s depending on which of the elements $a, b, c$ belong to $X$ (with 1 indicating yes, and 0 no). Write the images $f(∅)$, $f(\{a, c\})$, $f(\{b\})$. Is $f$ a bijection?

### Question 5

#### Question

Use the theorem mentioned in Q2 to show that any set consisting of pairwise disjoint intervals of the real line (each of length > 0) is countable. *Hint: use the fact that $|ℚ|= ℵ₀$.*
