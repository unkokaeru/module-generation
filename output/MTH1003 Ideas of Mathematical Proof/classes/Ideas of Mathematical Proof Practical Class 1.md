### Question 3

#### Question

Use the method of undetermined coefficients to guess a formula for $1+ 3+ 5+\cdots+(2n- 1)$ as a quadratic expression in $n$, and then use mathematical induction to prove this formula. (Pretend as if you did not know the formula for the arithmetical progression...)

...

### Question 6

#### Question

What is wrong in the following "proof" that all men are bald? We use induction on the number of hairs on the head, $n$. Indeed, If $n= 1$, then a man with just one hair is of course bald. Suppose the assertion is true for $n= k$, that is, having $k$ hairs means the man is bald. Now, if he has $k+ 1$ hairs, it is just one more, surely, does not transform a man from being bald to non-bald. Thus, by the Axiom of Mathematical Induction, a man is bald if he has $n$ hairs, for any $n$.
