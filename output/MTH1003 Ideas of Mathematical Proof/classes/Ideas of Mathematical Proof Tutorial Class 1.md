### Question 2

#### Question

Where is a mistake in the following 'proof' that all triangles have the same area? $$\text{Obviously, it is sufficient to prove that, given any} n\text{ triangles, they all have the same area. We use induction on} n.\text{Indeed,}\newline\text{If we have one triangle, the assertion is of course true.}\newline\text{Suppose the assertion is true for} n= k.\text{Consider any} k+ 1\text{ triangles} T_{1},..., Tk+\newline\text{Apply the induction hypothesis to the first} k\text{ of them:}\newline T_{1},..., Tk\text{ all have the same area. Then apply the induction hypothesis to the last} k\text{ of them:} T_{2},..., Tk+1\text{ all have the same area. Then obviously all} k+ 1\text{ triangles} T_{1},..., Tk+1\text{ have the same area: area of} T_{1}=\text{ area of} T_{2}=...=\text{ area of} Tk=\text{ area of} Tk+1.\newline\text{Thus, by the Axiom of Mathematical Induction, the assertion is true for all} n,\text{ and therefore all triangles have the same area.}"$$

### Question 3

#### Question

How to tie a goat so that it can eat grass exactly within a semicircle? It is allowed to use several leashes, with several pegs. For example, one peg and leash mean that the goat eats within a circle. It is also allowed to string one rope tightly between two pegs, and to tie the goat with a leash to a small ring sliding on the first rope. *Hint: use intersections of sets.*
