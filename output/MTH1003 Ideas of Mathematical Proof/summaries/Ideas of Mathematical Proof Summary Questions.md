4. Use mathematical induction to prove that $\frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}+\frac{1}{2\cdot 3\cdot 4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n(n+ 1)(n+ 2)}=\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{2(n+ 1)(n+ 2)}$ for any positive integer $n$.

6. What is wrong in the following "proof" that all men are bald? We use induction on the number of hairs on the head, $n$. Indeed, If $n= 1$, then a man with just one hair is of course bald. Suppose the assertion is true for $n= k$, that is, having $k$ hairs means the man is bald. Now, if he has $k+ 1$ hairs, it is just one more, surely, does not transform a man from being bald to non-bald. Thus, by the Axiom of Mathematical Induction, a man is bald if he has $n$ hairs, for any $n$.
