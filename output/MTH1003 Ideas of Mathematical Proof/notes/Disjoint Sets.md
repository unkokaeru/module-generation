# Disjoint Sets

Disjoint sets are sets that have no elements in common. In other words, two sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set. Disjoint sets are also referred to as mutually exclusive sets.

## Definitions

- **Disjoint Sets**: Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if their intersection is the empty set, i.e., A ∩ B = ∅.

## Properties

1. Disjoint sets have no elements in common.
2. The union of disjoint sets is simply the combination of all the elements in the individual sets.

## Examples

1. **Example 1**: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 6}. The sets A and B are disjoint because their intersection is empty: A ∩ B = ∅.

2. **Example 2**: Consider the sets C = {a, b} and D = {1, 2}. These sets are also disjoint since C ∩ D = ∅.

## Real-life example

In a school, let set A represent the students who play basketball and set B represent the students who play volleyball. If a student plays only one sport, then set A and set B would be disjoint sets because a student cannot play both basketball and volleyball simultaneously.

## Historical Context

The concept of disjoint sets is fundamental in various branches of mathematics, including set theory, probability theory, and combinatorics. Disjoint sets play a crucial role in solving problems related to counting, partitioning, and probability calculations.
