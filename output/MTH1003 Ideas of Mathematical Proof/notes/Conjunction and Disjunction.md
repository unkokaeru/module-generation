# Conjunction and Disjunction

In mathematical logic, the concepts of **conjunction** and **disjunction** are fundamental. They are binary logical operations that take two propositions as inputs and combine them to form a new proposition. 

**Conjunction** is represented by the symbol $\land$ and is true if and only if both of its component propositions are true. For propositions $P$ and $Q$, the conjunction $P\land Q$ is true if $P$ is true and $Q$ is true, and false otherwise. 

**Disjunction** is represented by the symbol $\lor$ and is true if at least one of its component propositions is true. For propositions $P$ and $Q$, the disjunction $P\lor Q$ is true if $P$ is true, $Q$ is true, or both $P$ and $Q$ are true, and false only when both $P$ and $Q$ are false.

## Examples

1. Let $P$ be the proposition "It is sunny" and $Q$ be the proposition "It is not raining". The conjunction $P\land Q$ would be true when it is sunny and not raining simultaneously.

2. Consider the propositions $R$: "The number is even" and $S$: "The number is divisible by 3". The disjunction $R\lor S$ would be true for any number that is either even or divisible by 3, or both.

## Historical Context

The study of conjunction and disjunction dates back to ancient Greek philosophy. Aristotle, one of the pioneers in logic, laid down the foundations of conjunction and disjunction with his categorical propositions and syllogistic reasoning.

In modern times, the concepts of conjunction and disjunction have found applications not only in pure mathematics and logic but also in computer science, artificial intelligence, and various fields of engineering.

## Exam Questions

1. Let $A$ be the proposition "The number is prime" and $B$ be the proposition "The number is odd". Write the truth table for the conjunction $A\land B$.
2. Consider the propositions $X$: "The circle is red" and $Y$: "The square is blue". Determine the truth value of the disjunction $X\lor Y$ if the circle is red but the square is not blue.
3. How do the truth tables for conjunction and disjunction differ from each other? Provide an example to illustrate this difference.
