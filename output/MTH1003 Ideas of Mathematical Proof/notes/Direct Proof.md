# Direct Proof

In mathematics, a **direct proof** is a method of proving a statement by logically reasoning from known assumptions and axioms to a conclusion. This type of proof proceeds by a series of logical implications starting from the given assumptions and ending with the desired conclusion. It is a fundamental and commonly used technique in mathematical proofs.

## Key Concepts:

- **Assumptions**: Direct proofs start with a list of assumptions or premises. These are the initial statements that are known to be true and are used as a starting point for the proof.
  
- **Logic**: The proof progresses by applying logical deductions such as modus ponens, modus tollens, and transitivity of implications.
  
- **Conclusion**: The final step of a direct proof is the establishment of the desired conclusion based on the logical progression from the assumptions.

## Example:

**Theorem**: *The sum of two even integers is even.*

**Proof**:
Let $a$ and $b$ be even integers. By definition, an even integer can be expressed as $a= 2m$ and $b= 2n$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Adding $a$ and $b$, we get:

$$a+ b= 2m+ 2n= 2(m+ n).$$

Since $m+ n$ is an integer, we have expressed the sum $a+ b$ as twice an integer, which means it is an even integer. Therefore, the sum of two even integers is even.

## Historical Context:

The concept of direct proof can be traced back to ancient Greek mathematicians such as Euclid, who employed this method extensively in his *Elements*. Euclid's direct proofs laid the foundation for modern mathematical reasoning and the axiomatic method.

## Real-life Application:

Direct proofs are not only essential in theoretical mathematics but also have real-life applications. For example, in computer science, proving the correctness of algorithms often involves direct proofs to ensure that the algorithm behaves as expected in all cases.

## Exam Questions:

1. **Prove that the sum of two odd integers is even using a direct proof.**

2. **Explain the importance of direct proofs in mathematical research. Provide examples.**

3. **Consider the statement: "If $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even." Use a direct proof to verify this statement.**

Through direct proofs, mathematicians establish the validity of mathematical statements and deepen their understanding of various mathematical concepts.
