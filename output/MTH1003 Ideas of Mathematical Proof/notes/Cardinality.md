# Cardinality

In mathematics, cardinality is a measure of the "number of elements" of a set. More formally, it is a way of comparing the sizes of sets, even infinite ones.

## Definitions

1. **Equal Cardinality**: Two sets have equal cardinality if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between the elements of the two sets.
   
2. **Finite Cardinality**: A set is said to have a finite cardinality if its elements can be counted, and it is represented by a natural number.

3. **Infinite Cardinality**: A set is said to have an infinite cardinality if it is not finite.

4. **Countably Infinite**: A set has a countably infinite cardinality if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3,\ldots\}$.

5. **Uncountably Infinite**: A set has an uncountably infinite cardinality if its elements cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.

## Examples

1. Consider the sets $A=\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B=\{a, b, c\}$. Since there exists a bijection between the two sets ($1\leftrightarrow a, 2\leftrightarrow b, 3\leftrightarrow c$), they have equal cardinality.
   
2. The set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ has a countably infinite cardinality. This can be seen by constructing a bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of positive even integers $\{2, 4, 6,\ldots\}$.
   
3. The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ has an uncountably infinite cardinality. This was famously proven by Cantor's diagonal argument, which shows that there cannot exist a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers.

## Historical Context

The study of cardinality and infinite sets was revolutionized by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century. Cantor introduced the concept of different infinity levels (countable and uncountable infinities) and developed the theory of cardinal numbers to compare infinite sets.

Cantor's work faced significant resistance, including from prominent mathematicians of his time who found his ideas on infinity paradoxical. However, Cantor's theories laid the foundation for modern set theory and have become essential in various branches of mathematics.

## Real-life Example

Consider the set of even numbers $E=\{2, 4, 6,\ldots\}$ and the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3,\ldots\}$. Despite the set of even numbers being a proper subset of $\mathbb{N}$, they both have the same cardinality as they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence.

## Exam Questions

1. Prove that the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$.
2. Explain Cantor's diagonal argument and how it establishes the uncountable infinity of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
3. Give an example of two infinite sets with different cardinalities, and explain why they cannot have a bijection between them.
