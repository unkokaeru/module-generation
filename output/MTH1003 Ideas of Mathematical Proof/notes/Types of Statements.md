# Types of Statements

In mathematics, statements play a crucial role in the formulation and proof of theorems. Understanding the types of statements that mathematicians work with is fundamental in the study of various mathematical disciplines. In this note, we will explore some common types of statements encountered in mathematics.

## 1. Universal Statements

### Definition:
A **universal statement** is a statement that asserts that a certain property holds for every element in a set. It is of the form "For all $x$ in $S$, $P(x)$ is true", where $S$ is the set of elements under consideration and $P(x)$ is the property assigned to each element $x$ in $S$.

### Example:
- "For all natural numbers $n$, $2n$ is an even number."

### Real-life example:
- "Every triangle has three sides."

## 2. Existential Statements

### Definition:
An **existential statement** asserts the existence of at least one element in a set that satisfies a certain property. It is of the form "There exists an $x$ in $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true".

### Example:
- "There exists a real number $x$ such that $x^2= 4$."

### Real-life example:
- "There is a student in the class who scored full marks in the exam."

## 3. Conditional Statements

### Definition:
A **conditional statement** consists of two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion. It asserts that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion is also true. It is of the form "If $P$, then $Q$", where $P$ represents the hypothesis and $Q$ represents the conclusion.

### Example:
- "If $x$ is an even number, then $x^2$ is also an even number."

### Real-life example:
- "If it is raining, then the streets will be wet."

## Historical Context:
The study of different types of statements can be traced back to the works of ancient Greek mathematicians such as Euclid and Pythagoras. Euclid's *Elements* laid the foundation for the systematic approach to mathematical proofs using statements like "For every point, there exists a unique line that passes through it." These foundational ideas paved the way for the development of logic and proof theory.

## Exam Questions:
1. State whether the following statement is universal, existential, or conditional: "For every prime number $p$, there exists another prime number $q$ such that $p< q$."
2. Give an example of a universal statement that is false.
3. Write a real-life example of a conditional statement that is not true in all cases.
