### Question

What is the **basis step** in mathematical induction?

### Answer

The **basis step** in mathematical induction is the initial step of the induction where we prove the statement holds for the base case, which is typically the smallest value of the variable for which we need to prove the statement.

---

### Question

How do we establish the foundation of an inductive proof?

### Answer

We establish the foundation of an inductive proof by proving that the statement is true for the base case, also known as the basis step. This sets the stage for proving the statement for all other cases through mathematical induction.

---

### Question

The basis step is crucial in a proof by mathematical induction as it demonstrates that the statement holds for the smallest value(s) of the variable, providing the starting point for the inductive proof to progress and establish the truth of the statement for all natural numbers.### Question

What is cardinality in mathematics and how is it defined?

### Answer

Cardinality in mathematics is a measure of the "number of elements" of a set. Two key definitions related to cardinality are:

1. **Equal Cardinality**: Two sets have equal cardinality if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between the elements of the two sets.

2. **Finite Cardinality**: A set is said to have a finite cardinality if its elements can be counted, and it is represented by a natural number.

---

### Question

Explain the concepts of countably infinite and uncountably infinite cardinalities with examples.

### Answer

1. **Countably Infinite**: A set has a countably infinite cardinality if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. For instance, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite.

2. **Uncountably Infinite**: A set has an uncountably infinite cardinality if its elements cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is an example of a set with uncountably infinite cardinality.

### Answer

Consider the set of even numbers $E=\{2, 4, 6,\ldots\}$ and the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3,\ldots\}$. Even though $E$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb{N}$, they both have the same cardinality as they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence.

--- 

### Question

Could you explain Cantor's diagonal argument and its implications on the cardinality of the real numbers?

### Answer

Cantor's diagonal argument is used to prove that the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ has an uncountably infinite cardinality.

--- 

### Question

Name and explain two key examples of different infinite sets with distinct cardinalities and why they cannot have a bijection between them.

### Answer

One example of sets with different cardinalities is the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. These sets have different cardinalities due to Cantor's diagonal argument, which shows that their elements cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence.### Question

### Question

Prove using a direct proof that the sum of two odd integers is even.

### Answer

Suppose we have two odd integers, denoted by *x* and *y*. By definition, an odd integer can be written as *x = 2m + 1* and *y = 2n + 1* for some integers *m* and *n*. The sum of these two odd integers is *x + y = (2m + 1) + (2n + 1) = 2(m + n) + 2 = 2(m + n + 1)*. Since *m + n + 1* is an integer, we can rewrite the sum as an even number given by *2k*, where *k = m + n + 1*. Therefore, the sum of two odd integers is even.### Question
