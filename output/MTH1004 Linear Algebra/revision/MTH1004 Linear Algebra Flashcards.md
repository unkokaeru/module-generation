### Question

Prove or disprove: The union of two subspaces of a vector space is always a subspace.

### Answer

The statement "The union of two subspaces of a vector space is always a subspace" is not always true. Counterexamples can be found where the union of two subspaces fails to satisfy closure under addition and scalar multiplication.

### Question

Is the set $W$ of all polynomials of the form $a_0 + a_1x$ a subspace of $P(\mathbb{R})$?

### Answer

The set $W$ of all polynomials of the form $a_0 + a_1x$ is not a subspace of $P(\mathbb{R})$ as it does not contain the zero polynomial, violating the necessary property for a subspace.### Question

What is a symmetric matrix in linear algebra?

### Answer

A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose, meaning $A = A^\top$ where $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix.

### Question

Why is the sum of two symmetric matrices always symmetric?

### Answer

The sum of two symmetric matrices is always symmetric because the sum of corresponding elements remains the same when the matrices are added together, meeting the definition of a symmetric matrix.### Question

What is a vector and how is it typically represented?

### Answer

**Vector:** A vector is a quantity characterized by both magnitude and direction. It is typically represented by an arrow pointing in a specific direction, with the length of the arrow indicating the magnitude of the vector.

### Question

How is vector addition defined and what are the methods used to visualize it geometrically?

### Answer

**Vector Addition:** Vector addition is the operation of combining two or more vectors to produce a resultant vector. This is achieved by adding the corresponding components of the vectors involved. Geometrically, vector addition can be visualized using the head-to-tail method or the parallelogram method.

### Question

In $\mathbb{R}^2$, how is the sum of two vectors $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\ v_2\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}$ calculated?

### Answer

The sum of vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by $\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}$.

---

### Question

For vectors $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} 2\\-3\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} 4\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$, what is $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$?

### Answer

$\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\-3\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 4\\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6\\-2\end{bmatrix}$.

---

### Question

Define scalar multiplication of a vector and how it affects the vector.

### Answer

**Scalar Multiplication:** Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar (a real number), changing the magnitude of the vector without affecting its direction. If the scalar is negative, the direction of the vector is reversed.

---

### Question

Given $k = 3$ and $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$, what is $3\vec{v}$?

### Answer

$3\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-3\\ 6\end{bmatrix}$.

---

### Question

Explain the historical development of the concept of vectors and the contribution of mathematicians towards formalizing them.

### Answer

Vectors date back to the 19th century, with mathematicians like William Rowan Hamilton and J.J. Sylvester introducing the concept of directed line segments. The formalization of vectors as mathematical entities was further developed by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside.

---

### Question

Provide a real-life example of how vectors are used in physics and explain the importance of vector addition in the context of forces.

### Answer

In physics, vectors represent quantities like velocity, acceleration, and force. Vector addition is crucial for determining the net force acting on an object by combining individual forces acting in different directions.

### Question

Explain the geometric interpretation of scalar multiplication of vectors with negative scalars.

### Answer

When multiplying a vector by a negative scalar, the direction of the vector is reversed while the magnitude is altered but remains positive.
