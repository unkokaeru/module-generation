# Orthogonal and Orthonormal Vectors

In mathematics, vectors are considered orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other in Euclidean space. Orthogonal vectors play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics, including linear algebra and geometry. 

## Definition

Let $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ be two vectors in an inner product space. The vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are **orthogonal** if their dot product is zero, i.e., $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}= 0$. Geometrically, two vectors are orthogonal if they meet at a right angle (90 degrees).

### Properties of Orthogonal Vectors:
1. If $\mathbf{u}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}$, then $\mathbf{v}$ is also orthogonal to $\mathbf{u}$.
2. The zero vector is orthogonal to every vector.

## Orthonormal Vectors

A set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_n\}$ is **orthonormal** if each vector in the set has unit length (i.e., $\lVert\mathbf{v}_i\rVert= 1$ for all $i$) and if every pair of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal (i.e., $\mathbf{v}_i\cdot\mathbf{v}_j= 0$ for all $i\neq j$).

### Properties of Orthonormal Vectors:
1. The vectors in an orthonormal set are linearly independent.
2. If $\{\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_n\}$ is an orthonormal set, then the vector $\mathbf{v}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors using the inner product, i.e., $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}_i)\mathbf{v}_i$.

Orthonormal vectors often play a significant role in various mathematical applications, such as signal processing, quantum mechanics, and data compression.

## Example

Consider two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$:
$\mathbf{u}=(1,-1)$ and $\mathbf{v}=(1, 1)$.

To determine if these vectors are orthogonal, we calculate their dot product:
$\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}= 1\cdot 1+(-1)\cdot 1= 1- 1= 0$.

Since the dot product is zero, $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are orthogonal.

## Historical Context

The concept of orthogonal vectors has a rich historical background. The notion of orthogonality dates back to ancient Greek mathematicians. Euclid, known as the "Father of Geometry," extensively studied orthogonal vectors in his work *Elements*. The Pythagorean theorem, which deals with the lengths of the sides of a right triangle, is closely related to the concept of orthogonality.

## Real-life Example

In engineering and physics, orthogonal vectors are used to describe forces acting in different directions. For instance, in structural engineering, if two forces are orthogonal, they are independent of each other and do not affect each other's magnitude or direction. This concept is crucial in determining the stability of structures under various loads.

## Exam Questions
1. Given two vectors $\mathbf{a}=(3,-2, 1)$ and $\mathbf{b}=(1, 4,-3)$, determine if they are orthogonal.
2. Prove that the standard basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ form an orthonormal set.
3. Explain how orthonormal vectors can be used in data compression algorithms.

Remember, understanding the properties of orthogonal and orthonormal vectors is fundamental in various mathematical disciplines.
