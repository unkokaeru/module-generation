# Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication

In mathematics, vectors are essential tools used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Vector addition and scalar multiplication are fundamental operations involving vectors that are crucial in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

## Definitions:

1. **Vector:** A vector is a quantity that is characterized by both magnitude and direction. It is typically represented by an arrow pointing in a specific direction, with the length of the arrow representing the magnitude of the vector.

2. **Vector Addition:** Vector addition is the operation of combining two or more vectors to produce a resultant vector. This operation is achieved by adding the corresponding components of the vectors involved. Geometrically, vector addition can be visualized using the head-to-tail method or the parallelogram method.

3. **Scalar Multiplication:** Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar (a real number). This operation changes the magnitude of the vector without affecting its direction. If the scalar is negative, the direction of the vector is reversed.

## Vector Addition:

Let $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\ v_2\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} w_1\\ w_2\end{bmatrix}$ be two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The sum of these vectors, denoted as $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$, is calculated as:

$$\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} v_1+ w_1\\ v_2+ w_2\end{bmatrix}$$

### Example:
Let $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} 2\\-3\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} 4\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$. To find $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$, we add the corresponding components:

$\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} 2\\-3\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} 4\\ 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 6\\-2\end{bmatrix}$

Therefore, $\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\begin{bmatrix} 6\\-2\end{bmatrix}$.

## Scalar Multiplication:

Let $k$ be a scalar and $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\ v_2\end{bmatrix}$ be a vector. The scalar multiple of the vector, denoted as $k\vec{v}$, is given by:

$$k\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix} k v_1\\ k v_2\end{bmatrix}$$

### Example:
Let $k= 3$ and $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$. The scalar multiple $k\vec{v}$ is calculated as:

$$3\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-3\\ 6\end{bmatrix}$$

Therefore, $3\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}-3\\ 6\end{bmatrix}$.

## Historical Context:

The concept of vectors dates back to the 19th century when mathematicians such as William Rowan Hamilton and J.J. Sylvester introduced the idea of directed line segments. The formalization of vectors as mathematical entities was later developed by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside. Today, vectors play a significant role in various branches of mathematics and physics.

## Real-life Examples:

1. In physics, vectors are used to represent quantities like velocity, acceleration, and force. Vector addition is crucial in determining the net force acting on an object by combining individual forces acting in different directions.

2. In computer graphics, vectors are used to represent points in space. Scalar multiplication is used to scale these vectors when resizing images or objects on a screen.

## Exam Questions:

1. Given vectors $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix} 3\\-1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\ 4\end{bmatrix}$, find $\vec{u}+\vec{v}$.
  
2. If $\vec{a}=\begin{bmatrix} 5\\-2\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{b}=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$, calculate $3\vec{a}- 2\vec{b}$.
  
3. Explain the geometric interpretation of scalar multiplication of vectors with negative scalars.
