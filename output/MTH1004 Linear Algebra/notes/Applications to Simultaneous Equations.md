# Applications to Simultaneous Equations

Simultaneous equations are a fundamental topic in algebra that involve multiple equations with the same variables. These equations are usually solved by finding a set of values for the variables that satisfy all the equations simultaneously. Simultaneous equations find wide applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science.

## Definition and Formulation

A system of simultaneous equations can be expressed in the form:

$$\begin{aligned}
a_{11}x_1+ a_{12}x_2+\ldots+ a_{1n}x_n&= b_1\\
a_{21}x_1+ a_{22}x_2+\ldots+ a_{2n}x_n&= b_2\\&\vdots\\
a_{m_{1}}x_1+ a_{m_{2}}x_2+\ldots+ a_{mn}x_n&= b_m\\\end{aligned}$$

where $a_{ij}$ are the coefficients, $x_i$ are the variables, and $b_i$ are the constants for $i= 1,\ldots, n$ and $j= 1,\ldots, m$.

## Real-life Examples

- **Finance**: Simultaneous equations are commonly used in finance to determine unknown quantities such as interest rates or loan terms in multiple transactions.
  
- **Physics**: In physics, simultaneous equations help solve problems involving multiple unknowns, such as finding the tension in different ropes in a system of pulleys.
  
- **Engineering**: Engineers use simultaneous equations to analyze complex systems with multiple variables, such as electrical circuits or structural mechanics.

## Historical Context

The study of simultaneous equations dates back to ancient civilizations like Babylonians and Egyptians who used them to solve real-life problems. However, the formal methods for solving these equations were developed in the Islamic Golden Age by mathematicians like Al-Khwarizmi, who laid the foundations of algebra, including techniques for solving systems of linear equations.

## Solving Methods

Various methods can be employed to solve simultaneous equations, such as substitution, elimination, matrix methods, and Gaussian elimination. These methods rely on manipulating the equations to isolate variables and find consistent solutions.

## Exam Questions

1. Solve the following system of equations using the substitution method:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   2x+ 3y&= 9\\
   4x+ y&= 8\end{aligned}$$

2. Use Gaussian elimination to solve the system of equations:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   3x+ 2y&= 7\\
   6x- y&= 11\end{aligned}$$

3. Apply the method of your choice to solve the following system of equations:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   x+ 2y+ z&= 6\\
   2x- y+ 3z&= 7\\
   3x+ 4y- z&= 8\end{aligned}$$


Remember to show all your work and justify the steps taken to solve these systems of equations.

Simultaneous equations serve as a powerful tool in modeling and solving real-world problems by converting complex scenarios into mathematical equations that can be systematically solved.
