### Question 1

#### Question

Consider the following transformations:
(i) $T:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ $T\begin{bmatrix} x\\ y\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-y\\ x-y\\ 2x-y\end{bmatrix}$
(ii) $T:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ $T\begin{bmatrix} x\\ y\\ z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x+2y\\ y-2z\\ x+y+z\end{bmatrix}$
(iii) $T:\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ $T\begin{bmatrix} x\\ y\\ z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x-y+z\\ x+y-z\end{bmatrix}$
