### Question

Given two bases $B=\{v_1, v_2\}$ and $C=\{w_1, w_2\}$, calculate the change of basis matrix from $B$ to $C$ if $[v_1]_C=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$ and $[v_2]_C=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$.

### Answer

To calculate the change of basis matrix from $B$ to $C$, we construct a matrix where the columns are the coordinates of the basis vectors of $C$ expressed in terms of basis $B. 

For $v_1$, we have $[v_1]_C=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$, which implies the first column of the change of basis matrix is $[v_1]_B=\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$.

For $v_2$, we have $[v_2]_C=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$, which implies the second column of the change of basis matrix is $[v_2]_B=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$.

Therefore, the change of basis matrix from $B$ to $C$ is:
$$P_{B\rightarrow C}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1\\ 2 & 3\end{bmatrix}$$

### Answer

For two parallel vectors **a** and **b**, the dot product can be expressed using the magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. Since the angle between parallel vectors is 0 degrees, $\cos(0)=1$, resulting in the dot product being equal to the product of their magnitudes: $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = |\mathbf{a}|\cdot|\mathbf{b}| \cdot \cos(0) = |\mathbf{a}|\cdot|\mathbf{b}|$.

---

### Question

Define the inverse of a matrix and explain why not all matrices have inverses.

### Answer

#### Definition of Inverse Matrix
The inverse of a square matrix $A$, denoted as $A^{-1}$, is a matrix such that when $A$ is multiplied by $A^{-1}$, it results in the identity matrix $I$. In other words, if $A\cdot A^{-1}= A^{-1}\cdot A= I$, then $A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $A.

#### Existence of Inverse
Not all square matrices have inverses. For a matrix to have an inverse, it must be a non-singular matrix, meaning its determinant is non-zero. If the determinant of a square matrix $A$ is zero, then it is a singular matrix and does not have an inverse. 

---

### Question

Compute the inverse of the following $2\times 2$ matrix: $A=\begin{bmatrix} 2& 1\\ 1& 3\end{bmatrix}$.

### Answer

Given matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix} 2& 1\\ 1& 3\end{bmatrix}$.

To find the inverse of $A$, we can use the formula:

$$ A^{-1}=\frac{1}{\text{det}(A)}\text{adj}(A)$$

First, calculate the determinant of $A$:
$\text{det}(A)=2\cdot 3 - 1\cdot 1 = 5$

Next, find the adjugate matrix $\text{adj}(A)$:

$\text{adj}(A)=\begin{bmatrix} 3& -1\\ -1& 2\end{bmatrix}$

Finally, compute the inverse using the formula:

$A^{-1}=\frac{1}{5}\cdot \begin{bmatrix} 3& -1\\ -1& 2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{3}{5}& -\frac{1}{5}\\ -\frac{1}{5}& \frac{2}{5}\end{bmatrix}$

Therefore, the inverse of matrix $A$ is $A^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{3}{5}& -\frac{1}{5}\\ -\frac{1}{5}& \frac{2}{5}\end{bmatrix}$.

---

### Question

Prove that if $A$ is an invertible matrix, then $kA$ is also invertible for any $k\neq 0$, and find an expression for $(kA)^{-1}$ in terms of $A^{-1}$ and $k.

### Answer

Given an invertible matrix $A$ and a scalar $k\neq 0$.

To show that $kA$ is invertible, consider the inverse of $kA$ as $(kA)^{-1}=\frac{1}{k}\cdot A^{-1}$.

Let's verify the result:

$(kA)(kA)^{-1}=kA\cdot\frac{1}{k}\cdot A^{-1}=A\cdot A^{-1}=I$

Similarly, $ (kA)^{-1}(kA)=\frac{1}{k}\cdot A^{-1}\cdot kA=A^{-1}\cdot A=I$

Therefore, $kA$ is invertible, and $(kA)^{-1}=\frac{1}{k}\cdot A^{-1}$.

This shows that if $A$ is an invertible matrix, then for any scalar $k\neq 0$, $kA$ is also invertible, and the inverse of $kA$ is $\frac{1}{k}\cdot A^{-1}$.### Question

### Question

### Answer

The standard matrix representation of $T$ can be obtained by arranging the images of the basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^3$ as columns in a matrix.
$T(\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} 2\\ 0\end{bmatrix}$,
$T(\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}$,
$T(\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 1\end{bmatrix}) = \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$.

Therefore, the standard matrix representation of $T$ is $A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 3\end{bmatrix}$.

---

### Question

Show that the composition of two linear maps is also a linear map.

### Answer

Let $S: U \to V$ and $T: V \to W$ be linear maps. To show that the composition $T \circ S: U \to W$ is a linear map, we need to demonstrate additivity and homogeneity.

For additivity:
$(T \circ S)(\mathbf{u}_1 + \mathbf{u}_2) = T(S(\mathbf{u}_1 + \mathbf{u}_2)) = T(S(\mathbf{u}_1) + S(\mathbf{u}_2)) \\
= T(S(\mathbf{u}_1)) + T(S(\mathbf{u}_2)) = (T \circ S)(\mathbf{u}_1) + (T \circ S)(\mathbf{u}_2)$.

For homogeneity:
$(T \circ S)(a\mathbf{u}) = T(S(a\mathbf{u})) = T(aS(\mathbf{u})) = aT(S(\mathbf{u})) = a(T \circ S)(\mathbf{u})$.

Therefore, the composition of two linear maps is also a linear map.

### Answer

A vector space is a mathematical structure denoted by a set $V$ along with two operations: vector addition, denoted by $+$, and scalar multiplication, denoted by $\cdot$. The eight axioms that define the structure of a vector space are:
1. **Closure under addition**: For any vectors $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in V$, their sum $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}$ is also in $V$.
2. **Associativity of addition**: $(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w})+\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{v}+(\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{u})$ for all $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w},\mathbf{u}\in V$.
3. **Existence of additive identity**: There exists a vector $\mathbf{0}\in V$ such that for any vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{0}=\mathbf{v}$.
4. **Existence of additive inverse**: For every vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, there exists a vector $-\mathbf{v}\in V$ such that $\mathbf{v}+(-\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{0}$.
5. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any scalar $a$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$, the product $a\mathbf{v}$ is also in $V$.
6. **Distributivity of scalar with respect to vector addition**: $a(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w})= a\mathbf{v}+ a\mathbf{w}$ for all scalars $a$ and vectors $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\in V$.
7. **Distributivity of scalar with respect to field addition**: $(a+ b)\mathbf{v}= a\mathbf{v}+ b\mathbf{v}$ for all scalars $a, b$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$.
8. **Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication**: $a(b\mathbf{v})=(ab)\mathbf{v}$ for all scalars $a, b$ and vector $\mathbf{v}\in V$.
